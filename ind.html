            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a computer science and IoT (Internet of Things) student, your academic journey likely involves
                exploring the intersection of technology and connectivity. In the realm of Computer Science, you delve
                into algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and software development. This foundation
                equips you to create innovative solutions, whether it's crafting applications, designing algorithms, or
                optimizing systems.

                As an IoT enthusiast, you're at the forefront of a transformative wave, where the digital world
                converges with the physical. Studying IoT involves understanding how devices, sensors, and networks
                seamlessly communicate and collaborate to make our surroundings smarter and more efficient. This
                interdisciplinary field opens avenues for creating intelligent systems that impact diverse sectors, from
                healthcare and agriculture to smart cities. </p>
